<p>Conjuration cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 poison damage.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. This spell’s damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="firebolt"><a class="header" href="#firebolt">Firebolt</a></h3>
<p>Evocation cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn’t being worn or carried.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. This spell’s damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="mage_hand"><a class="header" href="#mage_hand">Mage_Hand</a></h3>
<p>Conjuration cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute</p>
<p>A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.</p>
<p>You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.</p>
<p>The hand can’t attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="mending"><a class="header" href="#mending">Mending</a></h3>
<p>Transmutation cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (two lodestones)
Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.</p>
<p>This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can’t restore magic to such an object.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="message"><a class="header" href="#message">Message</a></h3>
<p>Transmutation cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)
Duration: 1 round</p>
<p>You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.</p>
<p>You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="minor_illusion"><a class="header" href="#minor_illusion">Minor_Illusion</a></h3>
<p>Illusion cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: 1 minute</p>
<p>You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.</p>
<p>If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.</p>
<p>If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.</p>
<p>If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="level-one-spells"><a class="header" href="#level-one-spells">Level One Spells</a></h2>
<h3 id="detect_magic"><a class="header" href="#detect_magic">Detect_Magic</a></h3>
<p>1st-level divination (ritual)</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.</p>
<p>The spell can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="identify"><a class="header" href="#identify">Identify</a></h3>
<p>1st-level divination (ritual)</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a pearl worth at least 100 gp and an owl feather)
Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.</p>
<p>If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="shield"><a class="header" href="#shield">Shield</a></h3>
<p>1st-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the magic missile spell
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round</p>
<p>An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from magic missile.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="thunderwave"><a class="header" href="#thunderwave">Thunderwave</a></h3>
<p>1st-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (15-foot cube)
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.</p>
<p>In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell’s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="level-two-spells"><a class="header" href="#level-two-spells">Level Two Spells</a></h2>
<h3 id="scorching_ray"><a class="header" href="#scorching_ray">Scorching_Ray</a></h3>
<p>2nd-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several. Make a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="shatter"><a class="header" href="#shatter">Shatter</a></h3>
<p>2nd-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a chip of mica)
Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>
<p>A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="level-three-spells"><a class="header" href="#level-three-spells">Level Three Spells</a></h2>
<h3 id="blink"><a class="header" href="#blink">Blink</a></h3>
<p>3rd-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute</p>
<p>Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already on that plane).</p>
<p>At the start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more that one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.</p>
<p>While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can't see anything more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creature that aren't there can't perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="catnap"><a class="header" href="#catnap">Catnap</a></h3>
<p>3rd-level Enchantment</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: S, M (a pinch of sand)
Duration: 10 minutes</p>
<p>You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range fall unconscious for the spell’s duration. The spell ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. If a target remains unconscious for the full duration, that target gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can’t be affected by this spell again until it finishes a long rest.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="fireball"><a class="header" href="#fireball">Fireball</a></h3>
<p>3rd-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 150 feet
Components: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)
Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="windwall"><a class="header" href="#windwall">Windwall</a></h3>
<p>3rd-level Enchantment
3rd-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.</p>
<p>When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can’t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can’t pass through it.</p>
